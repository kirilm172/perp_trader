## Benefits of the New Logging System

1. **Visual Clarity**: Rich formatting makes logs much easier to read and understand
2. **Better Debugging**: More detailed information about decision-making processes
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Periodic status reports provide ongoing visibility
4. **Error Tracking**: Enhanced error messages with context
5. **Performance Insights**: Better tracking of data feed and processing performance
6. **Financial Monitoring**: Clear visibility into profits, losses, and balances

## Color Coding Schema

- **Blue**: Informational messages, startup/shutdown
- **Green**: Successful operations, profits, positive values
- **Red**: Errors, failures, losses
- **Yellow**: Warnings, timeouts, checks
- **Cyan**: Data values, identifiers
- **Magenta**: Time-related information
- **Orange**: Fees, commissions, thresholds

This new logging system provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities while maintaining clean, readable output that helps with both development and production monitoring.
